# IoT-Based Smart Heating System

## Overview
This project is an **IoT-based Smart Heating System** that intelligently controls room temperature using an **Arduino** microcontroller. The system utilizes **temperature sensors** and **connectivity modules** to monitor and adjust heating settings based on environmental conditions. It enhances energy efficiency and provides remote control capabilities via a web or mobile application.

## Features
- **Automated Temperature Control**: Adjusts heating based on sensor readings.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Access system status via a web interface or mobile app.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimizes heating to reduce power consumption.
- **User Configuration**: Allows manual overrides and customized temperature settings.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Notifies users of abnormal temperature conditions.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Board** (Uno, Mega, or compatible)
- **Temperature Sensor** (e.g., DHT11, DHT22, or LM35)
- **Relay Module** (to control heating element)
- **Wi-Fi Module** (ESP8266/ESP32 for IoT connectivity)
- **Heating Element** (such as a heater or heating pad)
- **Power Supply** (based on the hardware specifications)

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** (for programming the microcontroller)
- **C/C++** (for writing Arduino code)
- **IoT Platform** (e.g., Blynk, Firebase, or MQTT broker)
- **Mobile App/Web Dashboard** (for remote monitoring and control)

## Installation & Setup
1. **Assemble the Hardware**
   - Connect the temperature sensor to the Arduino board.
   - Wire the relay module to control the heating element.
   - Integrate the Wi-Fi module for IoT connectivity.
2. **Upload the Code**
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Install necessary libraries (`DHT`, `ESP8266WiFi`, `Blynk`, etc.).
   - Upload the firmware to the Arduino board.
3. **Configure IoT Platform**
   - Set up a cloud dashboard to monitor temperature readings.
   - Configure alerts and remote control functions.
4. **Test the System**
   - Power on the setup and check real-time data.
   - Adjust temperature settings and validate responses.

## Usage
- Open the mobile app or web dashboard.
- Monitor real-time temperature and heating status.
- Adjust temperature settings manually if needed.
- Receive notifications for any temperature anomalies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **AI for predictive heating control**.
- Adding **voice assistant compatibility**.
- Implementing **machine learning for energy optimization**.
- Connecting with **smart home ecosystems**.
